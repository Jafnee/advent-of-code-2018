# advent-of-code-2018

My attempt at solving this year's advent of code. I'm primarily a Python developer.

My goals:

1. I'd like to improve my knowledge on what's available in the language's standard library. Will avoid using third party libraries.
2. Dabble in some new languages.
3. Have fun ðŸ˜¬

Languages:

* Python 3.6.7
* go1.12 linux/amd64
* node v12.2.0
* Dart VM version: 2.2.0
