# advent-of-code-2018

My attempt at solving this year's advent of code. I'm primarily a Python developer.

My goals:

1. I'd like to improve my knowledge on what's available in the language's standard library. Will avoid using third party libraries.
2. Dabble in some new languages.
3. Have fun ðŸ˜¬
